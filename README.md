As a group, choose one company to focus on. Going forward, you will be working with only one potential company idea.

As a group consolidate your style guide into one document. This should include all the materials required of P01.

As a group set up your dev environment and sync it through git. It should include your consolidated style guide in your files.

As a group build out a sitemap illustrating all the page templates and modules that will need to be built in order for the site to function as required, include layers illustrating:
what module elements each page template may be using
any linking between the pages that will be occurring
the hierarchy of pages
the titling of pages
