Having built out your component modules and templates, put together all the pages of your website as a group. Focus on:
linking the pages together
just navigation and key headings (do not fill in all the content at this point)
ensure that you have all the pages prepared for content
For product/service detail pages, do not create pages for every item, link us to one or two example listings from item options
