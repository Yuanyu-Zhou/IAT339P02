      <p>Can you speak English at a basic level, but would still like to speak more confidently in your daily life? Our intermediate-level lessons are focused on helping people communicate confidently in everyday life situations the way native speakers do. </p>

      <p>You can either attend lessons individually or part of a course. All of our courses include a free 1-on-1 coaching session, ongoing support and a certificate for successful completion.</p>

      <p>If you are someone who is just an English beginner or know someone that is, we recommend you get your English to a basic, early intermediate level first. A good way of doing this is with Duolingo, a free app.</p>
